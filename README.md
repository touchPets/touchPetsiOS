PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

touchPets is a pet simulation application for Android, PC, iOS devices in which the user is given stewardship of a variety of virtual “pets” that grow with every input by the player! (microphone, touch and screen rotation) 

Ensure the survival of your pet by stroking the pet (feeds happiness) or execute your will by poking fun at your experiment  (causes pain). Your creation exists and grows in a variety of environments made by your actions, along sides a settings menu at the heart of your creation. 

Nature and nurture is one aspect of creation but sound input (both from yourself) alongside your pets growls, laughs and strange songs. Over time your creature grows which you might first see when reopening the app a second time.
